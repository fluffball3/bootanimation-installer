# NetHunter Boot Animation Installer
This module enables easy installation of NetHunter boot-animations.

For more animations for Samsung devices, [check this repo.](https://github.com/John0n1/SMbootFX).

# Custom Animations

Adding custom boot animations are possible. [You can find some here.](https://xdaforums.com/t/bootanimations-100-custom-flashable-bootanimations-for-all-resolutions.3059659/)

* To install custom animations, download and extract the animation zipfile to find "bootanimation.zip".
* For safety purposes, directly installing bootanimation.zip is not allowed.
* Extract bootanimation.zip and then paste the contents into the installer's src_custom folder
* Repack the installer back into a zip file
