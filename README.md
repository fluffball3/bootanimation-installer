# Boot Animation Installer
This module enables easy installation of NetHunter boot-animations and custom animations.

For animations for Samsung devices, [check this repo.](https://github.com/John0n1/SMbootFX).

## Custom Animations

Adding custom boot animations are possible. [You can find some here.](https://xdaforums.com/t/bootanimations-100-custom-flashable-bootanimations-for-all-resolutions.3059659/)

* To install custom animations, download and extract the animation zipfile and also the module
* Paste the "system" folder or the bootanimation.zip inside the module's src_custom folder (this method doesn't support changing default values)
* To change resolution and fps values, instead of the previous method, extract the bootanimation.zip 
* and then paste the contents into src_custom folder
* Repack the installer back into a zip file
